<body>The Rizvi Education Society was established by Dr. AKHTAR HASAN RIZVI in the year 1982, who set his heart on the realization of a dream "the establishment of a mini university", catering to a variety of educational interests and aspirations. The Rizvi College of Arts, Science & Commerce was started in the academic year 1985-86. This was just the beginning of a line of successful ventures that were to follow. The amazing speed with which one professional institute followed another was awe-inspiring. Today, the Rizvi Educational Empire has expanded to unimaginable dimensions. As of now, we have twenty two institutes in all, not only in Mumbai but in Jaunpur, Allahabad (Kaushambi, Karari) as well.</body></font></p></b>
